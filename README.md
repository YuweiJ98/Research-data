# Research-data
This repostory is to show all the research data for my thesis "Data Infrastructures for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"

In this study, 53 papers were analyzed. Due to not all of them being open access, pdf files for these papers were included in the repository. 

To run the Jupyter notebook successfully, you need to do the following steps:
    1. Create a folder named "SDG7_papers", and make sure it is in the same hierarchy as the notebook
    2. Download the documents from Scopus to the folder created in the last step and ensure they have unique filenames
    3. Run the code, and then you can see the live version of the sunburst charts
